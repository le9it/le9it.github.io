Hello everyone, well, if there is anybody, the internet is vast afterall, im unsure if this will reach anyone, but here we go :D


Im le9it, a random self proclaimed developer from somewhere in this world, interested in electronics hardware, software, and anything related to computers and phones really

In this blog ill be writing about random stuff i happen to be interested in at the time, from tinkering with software/hardware to game review and thoughts about shows. do keep in mind i do this in my very little free time so don’t expect frequent updates:)

I hope you find any of the posts i publish here either useful or interesting in any way, shape, or form, and leave as a more knowledgable person after reading them, as my main goal from making a blog like this is sharing what i do which i hope at least 1 person in this world finds value in it
